    1: """__**Heart of Frost**__
    *A flower that has been frozen in time from the moment it was picked. The knight kept it as a memento forever after.*
    
    This flower once bloomed in a foreign land, but its colors faded after it became encased in ice.
    It was frozen when picked, serving as an eternal memento for the Knight of Boreas.
    
    The Knight of Boreas had a heart of firm iron and a body hardened like the glaciers of the North.
    Wolves befriended him and the North Wind accompanied him.
    
    Yet few knew he belonged not to the heartless snowscape of the North.
    His true home was filled with never-withering flowers and never-frozen rivers.
    But he left his homeland. For he had a ranger's boundless spirit, which conflicted with the sages' narrow idealism.
    The flower he picked became his loyal companion through countless winters.""",
    2: """__**Plume of Snow**__
    *A bird feather that was picked up by the knight who walked with the North Wind in the snow. It still awaits the day when it will thaw.*

    The feather of a bird that had never experienced the brisk winter is now frozen in ice.
    The memory of the knight this feather carries will eventually fade, just as the ice will thaw.
    
    The knight wandered along with the North Wind.
    As feared as he was respected, he became known as the Knight of Boreas.
    
    When the Knight of Boreas noticed the whispered complaints of the people, he would set off on another journey.
    Perhaps the day would come when the winter ended. Sometimes, the Knight of Boreas mused aloud to the North Wind:
    "A day may come whenâ€”"
    But the moment he spoke, his words would be frozen by the howling wind.
    
    "...when I can be in the land of spring, where flowers cover the earth and birds migrate homeward."
    Walking with the North Wind, the Knight of Boreas had always been waiting for the spring buried deep in his memory.
    Smiling wryly as he inspected the frozen feather, he wondered if the bird it came from shared his fate: lost in transit, with nowhere to call home.""",
    3: """__**Glacial Sand**__
    *A timepiece once used by the knight who walked with the North Wind. A never-ending snowstorm rages within.*

    An hourglass of ice.
    Eternal winds, not sands, flow inside.
    
    The Knight of Boreas walked with the North Wind, his armor covered in frost.
    On his endless journey, the cold winters were gifts scattered around the land.
    
    Solidified frost obstructed his movements in combat amidst storms.
    When the Knight of Boreas rested, hopes of brief respite were dashed as he saw the ice on his armor only grew thicker while stationary.
    The knight had long forgotten his days as a wanderer.
    The eternal icy winds had long since frozen time.""",
    4: """__**Goblet of Aquilo**__
    *A goblet of eonothem left behind by the knight who walked with the North Wind. The chill of the bitter winter frost still lingers within.*

    A ritual goblet forged of ice.
It holds not wine, but the hollering wind.
The howling wind of the North was like a ferocious wolf pursuing the knight along his path.
A normal traveler would have been devoured by the frosty wind.
But he was not a normal traveler.
In the storm, the knight raised the goblet filled with frosty wind and proposed a toast to his howling travel partner.
Together they drank, the bitter wind serving as their wine. The knight and the North Wind became friends.""",
    5: """__**Crown of Glacier**__
    *The crown worn by the knight who walked with the North Wind. It was forged using winter ice and silver.*

    A crown made of ice and silver,
oblivious to the spring of the North.
Along with the North Wind, the Knight of Boreas traveled through raging storms.
The Knight of Boreas fought with monsters on the icy plains of the North.
He traveled alone now, for the unrelenting blizzard had buried every last one of his companions in the snow.
The merciless wind itself had become his one faithful travel companion.
The hearts of those who look into the abyss shall be engulfed by the abyss,
and the souls of those who fall into the glaciers shall become trapped in the glaciers.""",
